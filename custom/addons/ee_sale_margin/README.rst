# ee_sale_margin

===================
Hide Margin of Sale
===================

Hide or Show Margin
===================

This module hide or show margin to sale_margin module as needed.
This is very interesting since when making budgets we can see the margin of our products, but in sales orders we can hide the margin of sale, so our clients cannot see our margin if they are looking at the screen.
The module always loads the margins as hidden, in the case that you want to see you have to uncheck the checkbox.
To check and uncheck the checkbox only sales managers have access.

You can download it on GitHub at the following link `https://github.com/esturao/ee_esturao <https://github.com/esturao/ee_esturao>`_.
